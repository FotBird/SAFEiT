# SAFEiT

This cool social distancing app uses the latest exciting features from SwiftUI and Augmented Reality to help you keep your distance at 2m at all times!

Choose between Dom the Drummer or Rom the Robot, Apple's awesome reality buddies (although we named them!) and point your (only latest versions of) iPhone camera to a fellow human.

Dom or Rom will appear at exactly 2m, keeping you at a safe distance.
